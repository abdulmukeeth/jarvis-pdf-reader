Jarvis: The PDF Guru
Jarvis is a PDF-based chatbot built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Gemini LLM. It allows users to upload a PDF document, ask questions about its content, and get relevant answers. The chatbot processes the PDF content locally and ensures that only PDF-relevant questions are answered.
